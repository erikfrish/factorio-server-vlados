Version: 2.0.23
  Major Features:
    - New rail shapes, rail curves, 22.5 degree tracks.
    - Added Train interrupts (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-389, https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-395)
      Trains can have number of interrupts, each interrupt has conditions and set of stops.
      Whenever is the train leaving a station, the first interrupt with fulfilled condition is activated, which adds its stations
      as temporary items into the schedule.
    - Added Train groups. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-389)
      Train name is editable and trains with the same name are considered to be in the same group.
      Editing schedule of a train automatically updates schedules of all the trains in the same group.
    - Added Logistic groups. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-382)
      Logistic group is editable for logistic points (Requester chest, Roboport, Character, Spidertron, etc.).
      Editing the requests of a logistic point automatically updates requests of all the points in the same group.
    - Added Factoriopedia. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-397)
      It provides detailed information about different kind of objects.
      ZL+ZR+Selecting any relevant gui element or game entity opens the related page.

    - Added super forced building mode. ZL + ZR + Build marks for deconstruction player's colliding entities and replaces ghosts and tiles. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-383)
    - Added search to the remote view. It allows to do surface wide search for recipe production, resources and train stations and map tags. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-400)
    - Blueprint parametrisation. Allows to make more generic bluprints, which are configured upon building. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-392)

    - Added a new alert for trains failing to pathfind to their target. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-395)
    - Added a new alert for turrets running out of ammunition. It only sounds once right when the ammo is used up.
    - Added fuel condition to the train schedule.
    - Added condition to the train schedule to check whether a specific station is full or not.

    - Smarter worker robot scheduling.
      Worker robots have task queue now which allows the planner to choose the robot that will be able
      to get to the destination fastest, even if it is doing something else at the moment.
    - Robot requests in roboports.
    - Added Flipping as a primary action to flip entities horizontally or vertically. Works on items in hand
      placed on the surface or ghosts. AssemblingMachines can now be mirrored by flipping them, allowing

      and setting up only the destination slot.

      Instead of spidertron remote being linked to single spidertron, it can be used to group select and command spidertrons like in your typical RTS game.
    - Spidertrons can be entered remotely, so you can control them as if you were inside physically, so switching the map on/off doesn't distrubt the mode.
    - Allowed opening and configuring entities through remote view. (https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-380)
    - When imported blueprint is placed, assembling machines will be configured with the recipe even when recipe is not yet researched.

    - Assembling machines, chemical plants, oil refineries and centrifuges can now send the ingredient list of their recipes to the circuit network.
    - Drag building electric poles will also drag circuit wires when starting from electric pole with already connected circuit wires.
    - When electric pole is removed, it will rewire circuit wires similar to copper wires.

    - Spidertrons can be damaged by cars and tanks, can be damaged by walking on fire, and can be slowed with slowdown capsules.

    - Improved the AI of the worker flying robots when it comes to choosing roboport to recharge.
      It prefers roboports closer to its destination, so (for example) it won't get stuck over lakes forever.
    - When you retrieve your corpse, the logistic requests will re-enable if they were enabled before death.
      (Related to the already existing behaviour, where the requests are disabled upon death, to avoid unwanted supply)
    - Added an option to auto-pause servers while any player is connecting (defaults to false).

    - Added a reverse mode for deconstruction planner: when selecting an area, the white-/blacklist setting for entity and tile filters will be reversed for this selection.
    - Added a nondefault tile cover cache - last used cover tile is being saved per surface per force per tile id being covered. For most intents and purposes, those values act the same as default covers defined by covered tile prototype (for tiles without default cover defined).
